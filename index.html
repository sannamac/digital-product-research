      <h1><span>Emotional support for people in debt</span></h1>
      <time>October 2017</time>
    </header>

    <section class="situation">
      <p>
        People in debt often feel isolated. People who have got themselves out of debt wish they could support others who are in that situation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="complication">
      <p>
        Co-op has always stood for solidarity and self-help - helping people to help themselves in times of trouble. Could we bring these people together in a way that benefits all?
      </p>
      <h2>Talking about money is awkward, even when things are going well</h2>
      <p>
        When things aren’t going well, it’s even harder to broach the subject of debt. Read the comments on forums such as Debt Free Wannabe on moneysavingexpert.com and you’ll hear the same story. Loneliness and shame, not being able to talk to friends and family, and an inability to see past the here and now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Giving financial advice is a tightly regulated industry. If Co-op was to help people who have experienced debt support each other, we’d have to stop them from giving financial advice - something best left to the professionals.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="what-we-did">
      <h2>People who help people</h2>
      <p>
        In previous research, we’d met two people who had got out of debt and then offered emotional and practical support to friends currently in debt. They were proud of the help they’d been able to give, and had found it a positive experience. Could Co-op do something to scale up this willingness to help?
      </p>

      <p>
        We came up with Co-op Letters, a service for people who are in debt to receive letters from people who have previously been in debt.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started with a hypothesis: We believe that connecting people who can emotionally support people in debt with those who want help will result in them feeling less ashamed and alone. We will know we’ve succeeded when we see a positive emotional change in those receiving the letters.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the context of our current business activities, Co-op Letters is an unusual thing for Co-op to be doing. We wanted to learn how Co-op members would receive it and to learn what they would be happy to do to help each other when facilitated by a trusted mediator.
      </p>

      <h2>A handwritten letter</h2>

      <p>
        It’s a rare thing to get a handwritten letter. Personal communication happens electronically, via text, email or through social media. What lands on our doormats is almost always official correspondence, and for people in debt, a source of stress.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were inspired by Jodi Ann Bickley and her Million Lovely Letters project. Since 2013, Jodi Ann has written over 4,000 letters of support to people around the world. We were also influenced by Postcrossing, a pen pal service that connects people by sending postcards.
      </p>

      <h2>Scaling self help</h2>

        We posted an ad with a link to a brochure site on the Co-op members landing page.

        28 people got in touch to share the story of their debt and explain why they wanted to help someone else. Although these numbers were small, they gave us confidence that Co-op could connect people and help them them to support each other directly.

      <h2>I want to write because...</h2>

      <p>What we found in our interviews with people who had been in debt and had used that experience to help others was borne out by the responses to our ad.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I wasn’t the one in debt, my parents were. I want to give parents who are in debt the reassurance that they aren’t bad parents and they’re not letting their children down. I remember my mum being so upset when we had to sell our house to a company we now rent it off, thinking she’d let us kids down but we weren’t bothered as long as we were all together under the same roof.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I want to write to someone because I know how desperately isolating and terrifying it is to not have any money at all and to feel so desperate. You feel as if people will think badly of you even though the circumstances are sometimes beyond your control.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          [I want to write because]... All my family and friends turned their back on me, my partner and our baby when it all happened and just to give someone that bit of hope that there are people out there who have been through it and come out the other side...

      <h3>Making awkward things OK</h3>

      <p>
        We found that people who had been in debt were happy to talk about it when it was in the past or under control. But when the debt is current and out of control, it is hard to acknowledge the problem and seek help, either practical or emotional. How could we encourage people in debt to overcome their feelings of embarrassment and sign up to receive a letter?

        We posted another ad on the Co-op members landing page, and 35 people got in touch saying they were interested in receiving a letter. Thinking that people in debt would be harder to reach, we designed the ad so that participation would seem appealing and worth the effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired by a talk on Hacking Shyness by Sebastian Deterding, we followed these principles for encouraging participation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>set clear rules for the interaction</li>
        <li>explain what it is and what it isn’t</li>
        <li>associate the interaction with a higher purpose so that there’s an excuse or reason to take part</li>
        <li>give a starting point so that it’s easy to start the interaction</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We also knew that for people to take part, they would need to trust the other participants, despite not knowing them. We took inspiration from the way Airbnb design for trust, by Joe Gebbia. In our ad we showed an example of a letter from someone who had experienced debt where they talk about themselves and tell their own debt story.

          What are the risks of a service like this?
        </h2>
      <section class="answer">
        <p>
          We had to reduce the risks that could arise from the connections we facilitated between members. But we also wanted to take a platform-thinking approach to this service. A traditional approach would be to intercept every letter and check its quality. But the point of this experiment was to see what we could empower members to do for each other &mdash; at scale. Checking every letter would not be workable with more than a handful of participants.
        </p>

        <p>
          We spoke to a contact from the Samaritans on how to reduce risk when working with vulnerable people. What we learned from this conversation helped us preempt some things that might go wrong and put policies in place to mitigate against risk.

          Our biggest worry was that the people who had been in debt themselves might, with the best of intentions, give financial advice. We wanted to avoid anyone recommending a specific course of action. Instead we wanted them to focus on giving emotional support by telling their own story.
        </p>

        <p>
          As well as providing guidance for letter writers, we tackled this risk through a simple training quiz. We designed the training so that it was not possible to move on without passing the test.

          Being in debt means lots of chasing letters and emails and phonecalls. We agreed that we would limit our communications to the letter recipients to the minimum.

        <p>
          We agreed on another principle that every person in debt who signed up to receive a letter should receive one. We used our emails to the letter writers to make sure they understood that someone who was feeling vulnerable was expecting to get a letter from them. We designed the service with a reminders and nudges to letter writers to make sure they put pen to paper.

        <p>
          We were also concerned about holding personally identifiable information. We got around this by building the service on Django on an AWS box.

        <h2>People who have been in debt want to support people who are in debt</h2>

        <p>In our initial interviews with people thinking about retirement and what we learned from people who signed up to write letters, we found that people who had been in debt themselves were keen to help others facing a similar situation.</p>

        <p>We used the Co-op members landing page to recruit participants, so everyone involved was a Co-op member. It’s unclear whether Co-op membership was a factor in wanting to help, people were more motivated by the shared experience of debt.</p>

        <h2>People like the idea of writing a letter, but it’s hard to get round to it</h2>

        <p>Out of the people who expressed an interest in writing a letter and receiving a letter, we managed to match seven readers and writers. However, none of the people who said they would write managed to send one (as far as we know).</p>

        <p>Although this result was disappointing, it told us that Co-op members were willing to emotionally support other members in debt, but that the commitment of writing a letter and posting it was too great.</p>

        <h2>Talking about talking about debt seems to be helpful</h2>

        <p>One unexpected result from this experiment was a response from one participant — a reader — who got in touch with us to let us know that he no longer wanted to take part.</p>

        <p>This was because seeing our ad and signing up to take part had been a prompt for him to review his financial situation and work out a budget and a plan for getting his debt under control within a few months.</p>



        <!--People who are in debt appreciate emotional support around a taboo topic-->

        <!--We can find a supply and a demand and facilitate an interaction between strangers around a charged topic such as debt-->

        Around half of us have never switched energy company. Most non-switchers are with one of the ‘big six’ energy companies, paying more for power from oil, coal or fracked gas. Could we motivate non-switchers to switch to do good instead of profit?

        Switchers and non-switchers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Why do people switch? And why do so many people not switch? For people who do switch, it’s about price, which you’d expect.

      <p>
        People who haven’t switched are much more interesting - knowing that they’re overpaying doesn’t make them switch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-switchers don’t see much benefit of switching, and they perceive that researching, understanding and switching takes a lot of effort. True, the mechanics of switching is easy, but they’re right that it requires a level of commitment to learn to understand energy companies well enough to make a decent comparison.

      <p>
        15% of people switch often - every year - but the rest don’t. Small, green energy companies have used this insight: most people just don’t want to bother switching regularly - so these companies give them a good tariff that stays good, and don’t hike the price after a year.

      <h2>
        A community-benefit approach to switching
      </h2>
      <p>
        With that in mind - price doesn’t appear to influence non-switchers, they don’t see the benefit, and they expect it to be really difficult - we tried out a different approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tested working with schools to try and encourage non-switching (grand)parents to switch to green energy - not to save money, but to raise money for their school.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          school raise funds from the commission on every switch
        </li>
        <li>
          families help the school
        </li>
        <li>
          Co-op takes part of the commission
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Our two big assumptions
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>1. There’s value for the schools to recruit parents.</strong> We emailed 50 schools and 25 parent teacher associations inviting them to raise money with us. We tracked the emails and could see around half the emails being opened, but didn’t hear back from any. Granted, it was nearing the end of term, and many of the email addresses where generic, but it didn’t look promising.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2. Helping a school is compelling enough to make people switch.</strong> We also spoke to five parents of school children about their attitudes towards their energy providers. It was a chance to learn about them and what’s stopped them switching in the past.

      <h2>Light House: an LED lightbulb subscription service</h2>
      <p>
        LED light bulbs use a 10th of the energy of old fashioned ones. Switching all the bulbs in your house could save you over £100 a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, LED bulbs are relatively expensive. Refitting out a whole house costs somewhere in the region of £100 and so many households living in fuel poverty haven’t switched. In other words, those that could benefit the most, haven’t got the money.
      </p>
      <p>
        For £1 a week, Light House could offer these homes 20 LED light bulbs. After 3 years, they would own the bulbs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The capital to fund the programme would be raised by community energy companies, with no banks involved. The money would be lent by the community and stay where it belonged: in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created this model in collaboration with the community energy group Sheffield Renewables. We tested our early assumptions by talking to people working in and attending food banks. We then developed a proposition for Light House, and went door to door in a housing estate owned by Bromford Housing Association in Lichfield, Staffordshire.

          Hyper-awareness of short-term saving
        </h2>
        <p>
          From talking to people at a food bank, we found that some people in fuel poverty were highly conscious of their energy use and had developed tactics to reduce it (such as only having one light on at a time). We also found that most people had heard of energy saving (compact fluorescent lamp or CFL) bulbs and were using them at home. In contrast, not many people had heard of LED bulbs.

          When we spoke to housing association tenents, we didn't find anyone who would need the 20 bulbs that was on offer in our proposition.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Not much awareness of LED bulbs
        </h2>
        <p>
          People had heard of LED bulbs in other contexts, such as car lights. When people had heard of LEDs for use in the home, they thought they were only available for ceiling spot lights.

        <h2>
          People thought mostly about the cost of the bulb rather than the cost of the energy to run it
        </h2>
        <p>
          We found that people’s tactics for saving money were focused on the present, not the future. Many people spoke about light fittings that blew regularly, so they used incandescent bulbs for those fittings as they were cheap to replace. Others talked about buying incandescent bulbs for the low cost - despite the fact that this type of bulb is much more expensive in the long run.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Bulbs are already very confusing
        </h2>
        <p>
          Everyone we spoke to struggled to identify what types of bulbs they had. Most confused old-style incandescent bulbs with the newer, but similar looking, halogen bulbs.

        At many times in our lives we’re required to share personal information with organisations to prove our identity, income or otherwise. As the world turned digital, that increasingly moved from paper-based copies to scans over email. At the same time, email inboxes have grown, allowing us to archive, not delete.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="complication">
      <p>
        Sometimes organisations aren’t as careful with our data as we’d like them to be. Often people just need to get the job done, and that can mean good security practices fall by the wayside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose a mortgage advisor’s inbox was hacked: how many people’s identifying information would be sitting in their archive, waiting to be misused? How much personal information is lying around in your sent items, long forgotten, but rich pickings for an identity thief?
      </p>
      <p>
        At the sharper end, we met a Venezuelan human rights worker at the Internet Freedom Festival who told us about lawyers sending sensitive personal information about clients using Hotmail. In a regime where human rights lawyers are routinely targeted, and that information would put the client’s life at risk, the stakes are high.

        We started with the case where a Gmail user is asked to send over a scan of their passport. The person is in their inbox, and the simplest thing is to hit “reply”, attach the file and hit send.
      </p>
      <p>
        We thought this was a good point to intervene in the user’s behaviour - what if we replaced their “attach a file” button with an alternative?
      </p>
      <p>
        We built Atbash (a curious word referring to an ancient cipher) as an extension for the Chrome browser which modifies the Gmail web interface to do just that.

      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Human rights groups have stricter requirements for trust than most people and organisations due to the nature of their work. When an NGO is working against abuses by their own government, it’s unlikely they’ll trust a company that could be forced by that government to act against them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This community is suspicious of services that they can’t assess and understand. It’s not good enough for products to say “we won’t look at your stuff, honest” - that claim needs to be verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
        We looked at organisations like Open Whisper Systems who make the Signal messaging app for inspiration. Signal is developed entirely in the open, allowing anyone to see all the thinking, discussion and code that makes up the app. That’s important as it makes it practically difficult for the Signal developers to write malicious code without leaving traces. It also helps people understand the personal motivations and thought patterns of those developers, which also builds trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, if you’ve got the skills, you can download and modify Signal and make it work the way you’d like it to. That’s an important freedom that helps build trust: if Signal were to turn bad in the future, the community could “fork” it and continue developing it under a new guise.

        We built Atbash, a Chrome browser extension, along the same principles. Even though it was a small prototype, we started it as a public GitHub repository. Anyone who wants to understand it better is able to look back through the repository and see a complete history of every line of code.

        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Atbash was a prototype service for sending sensitive personal information to another person. There was no need for the service to be able to access that information, so we designed Atbash in a way that prevents that.
      </p>

      <p>
        There’s a big difference between “we <em>can’t</em> look at your stuff” and “we <em>won’t</em> look at your stuff”. Services like Google Drive and Dropbox take the “won’t” approach, and you have to trust them to keep that promise.
      </p>


      <p>
        End-to-end encrypted services are designed so they “can’t” see your stuff - at least not without sneakily altering the way the service works, which may be detected.
      </p>
      <p>
        We designed Atbash so the server would hold encrypted files, but that the key would only ever be transmitted between the user and their contact. In that way, the server never holds both the encrypted file and the key at the same time.

      <p>Inspired by successful local energy trading pilots in Bethesda and Shrivenham, we came up with Power Pack. Power Pack lets people set up an energy sharing club in their area to buy and sell energy with their neighbours. It offers a better price for everyone. Generators earn more for exporting and buyers pay less than the standard tariff. </p>

      <p>We’ve given people the opportunity to sign up (pledge) to join Power Pack, we also installed customer support software that allows us to chat to people as they are on the website.</p>

      <h3>Knocking on doors</h3>
      <p>We had doorstep conversations with nine people in a street in Sheffield. We gave them the opportunity to sign up to Power Pack and spoke to them about community renewable energy.</p>

      <h3>Minimum viable community</h3>
      <p>We also brought a group of producers and consumers of local renewable energy together. We wanted to learn whether people would join and if they’d be happy to take on some responsibility. We didn’t try to simulate the platform technology. Instead we recruited our group and spent time with them on a field trip.</p>

      <h3>Finding a renewable producer</h3>
      <p>We needed to find someone who was producing renewable energy in Sheffield and selling their excess back to the grid to host our field trip. We found a few different types of business with solar panels and wind turbines; utilities companies, sports stadiums, warehouses, bus stations and farms. Eventually we found a farmer who was happy to show us around his installation and host our field trip.</p>

      <h3>A trip to the farm</h3>
      <p>Povey Farm is a pig farm on the outskirts of Sheffield in the Moss Valley. The farmer, Stephen Thompson has installed two wind turbines, PV solar panels and a straw burner. Stephen was happy to show a group of people around his farm, talk about his renewable energy production, and host a follow-up group discussion in his kitchen.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>We recruited our group by promoting the trip to relevant groups and individuals in the Sheffield area. We ran two trips, one mid week which eight people came to and one at the weekend which five attended; a good turn-out, given that we publicised them at fairly short notice.</p>

      <blockquote class="pull-quote">

        <p>Everyone who came along was already interested in renewable energy. There were lots of detailed questions about the technology and finances. After the tour the group discussed similar projects, attendees’ own renewable energy technology and the role of the Co-op in such a scheme.</p>

        <p>After the events we surveyed the attendees to see if they’d be willing to join Power Pack in Sheffield. Four out of eight people completed the survey. Two attendees saying they would be willing to join, and two were interested if they had more information about the costs involved.</p>

        <h2>
          It’s a good story for a business
        </h2>

        <p>People and organisations generating renewable energy are generally open and happy to talk about it. They are proud of what they are doing. However, the larger the organisation the harder it is to navigate through customer service channels to find the right person to talk to.</p>

        <h2>It feels believable</h2>

        <p>We spoke to people in Sheffield on their doorsteps and found them enthusiastic. 6 out of 9 people signed up to Power Pack. They weren’t too bothered about understanding the technicalities, and were satisfied we knew what we were doing. Similarly, the people who attended our field trip to Povey Farm were happy to sign up and take part in a discussion - even with minimal information before the event.</p>

        <h2>Previous trials prove it could work</h2>

        <p>Once we had explained the idea behind Power Pack in more detail, no-one had any concerns. We discussed challenges but no-one dismissed the idea. Successful trials in Shrivenham and Bethesda validated the idea of a local energy trading club. Some attendees were interested in making solar installations financially viable, others liked the idea of supporting people in their community.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Interesting to see the energy set up and mix of solutions they’re using and also really valuable to chat to all the people and get a bit better informed.

        <h2>No-one mentioned climate change</h2>

        <p>Many people in the group were interested in the technology and engineering challenges without making any explicit references to environmental issues such as climate change. The challenge of setting up renewable energy schemes, and the rewards in terms of the money saved seemed to be motivation enough for some of the attendees.</p>

        <h2>Where we want to go next</h2>

        <p>If this is going to become a real scheme we need to understand more about the barriers between where we are and where we want to be.</p>

        <p>We are going to keep in touch with the people who’ve signed up. We would like them to become the founding members of Power Packs in their areas.</p>

      <p>
        The future is bleak for people in their 20s. High rents, low wages and a shrinking job market make the things this generation’s parents took for granted an impossibility; owning your own home, saving for a rainy day, taking early retirement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="complication">
      <h2>What will life after work in the year 2057 be like?</h2>
      <p>
        When we spoke to recent retirees, we heard that the (unpaid) work they did now meant a lot to them. They weren’t working out of financial need - volunteering gave their lives meaning, and a final salary pension allowed them to live the life they want.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a different story for people entering the workplace today. There’s no guarantee of a state pension, and people in their 20s are at the beginning of a very long working life. In 2057, 60- and 70-somethings won’t be working because it makes them happy, they’ll be working because they have to.
      </p>

      <h2>Conventional approaches to money will fail</h2>

      <p>
        There’s a lot of received wisdom about what to do with your money. When people follow the advice of their parents and peers, they’re likely to lose out. Reducing your spending by cutting out life’s little luxuries is a good start, but it’s only half the story, especially for this cash-strapped generation. And leaving your money in a savings account loses you money in the long term.
      </p>

      <h2>Start investing in your 20s - you’ll be grateful in your 60s</h2>

      <p>
        If you save small amounts by reducing your spending when you are young, and (crucially) invest that money in an investment account that pays a good rate of interest (4-7%), then the compound interest you accrue over 40 years will give you a passive income when you are ready to stop working. But most of us don’t get involved with investments - we think it’s too complicated, too risky.
      </p>

    <section class="what-we-did">

      <h2>Could we balance instant gratification and long term pay off?</h2>

      <p>
        Our goal is to give people a happier old age by getting them to rethink their approach to money at the point in their lives when they can take full advantage of compound interest.

      <p>
        To test this, we created a prototype of Level Up, a service to connect people who wanted to reduce their spending and increase their passive income with mentors who had successfully done this. We showed our prototype to four people in their early 20s. All were early career, renting or living with parents, earning more than &pound;20,000 a year and degree educated.

      <h2>Most people displayed ‘poor dad’ thinking</h2>

      <p>
        Through talking and trying out our product, we found that people in this group took a short-term view of their finances, and had little understanding of how banking and investments worked.
      </p>

      <p>They would go about saving for a short term goal (such as holidays) and a mid-term goal (such as a deposit for a flat) in the same way; by diverting money from their paycheck into a savings account on payday. </p>

      <p>They didn’t understand the concept of compound interest (as many don’t), and the explanation in our product did not help them. The idea of getting a passive income from interest earned on investments did make sense to our group, but was not something they felt they could get involved with. </p>

      <h2>People don’t know what state their finances are in</h2>

      <p>
        Our group tended to think of themselves as being in a good position with their money, but acknowledged that they did not know much about how money works or how to get the most from their salary.
      </p>

      <blockquote>

        Immediately transferring money on payday out of a current account (where it is at risk of being spent) and into a savings account (where it can be held for short- and mid-term needs) was seen as a sensible tactic for managing finances.

        When we introduced the topic of investment, everyone we spoke to felt it was risky in comparison to putting money in a savings account. Putting money into a savings account was seen as something that made them feel good about themselves, and investing was an activity that conflicted with the pride they took in their sensible choices.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I wouldn’t think about investing, I’d think about putting it in a savings account. Which is probably a fairly short sighted view. &hellip; like investment options.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m proud of my ability to save. I don’t want to put my money into something where I might not get it back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like investments are risky that might have big returns but might not.

      <h2>There was skepticism and confusion around the numbers</h2>

      <p>
        We realised we needed to explain in much more detail how compound interest works. Even though our examples were based on real numbers, our group did not believe them. We learned that this concept was very hard for our group to understand, despite their high level of academic attainment.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I don’t know the mechanics of that, but it feels like a lot, from just earning interest from a savings account. That feels quite a long way away from being achievable.

        <p>
          I’d like more info on that. I’m not convinced by this passive income thing. It sounds too good to be true.

      <p>
        We spoke to 5 people in their 50s and 60s who had recently stopped working. We also spoke to a number of people who work or volunteer with older people: a GP, a travel agent and representatives from the WI, U3A and Age UK.

        Retired people worry about being forgotten. They appreciate the friends, family and volunteers who advise them on their emotional, physical and financial welfare. And they want their needs to be understood and anticipated by the people around them.

        Contact with friends, family, volunteers and professionals is important. People like the WI groups that check up on members who miss meetings. Family who encourage exercise and activity. Peers who can relate and advise. Church groups that organise tea parties in people’s houses; support that starts in the home makes trying new things less daunting.

          <q>Who the hell am I?</q> Our working lives define us, whether we enjoy them or not. As work ends, it’s harder to define ourselves and understand our value. Making a contribution to society;  having a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Finding a post-work identity can mean re-inventing yourself, which takes courage and effort. It’s a two-way process too. We need signals back from the outside world to confirm we are useful and relevant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Doing new stuff helps. Taking on projects, learning a new skill, spending time with family and volunteering gives meaning to post-work lives. People who were new to post-work life told us that extra time with grandchildren, tackling ambitious home renovations and doing courses gave them joy and purpose. For people who are used to joining clubs it comes easier, for others it’s harder to <q>get off your backside</q>.

          Being able to make changes to the way you work as you get older is important. <q>Politics</q> at work and stress can mar the later years of working life. Retirees talked about having to adapt to changing working practices and falling out with colleagues, prompting their decision to stop working.

          Working less and working differently enables a gentler transition into post-work life. Taking on a less physical or less stressful role within the same company, or for a new company. A few retirees told us they enjoyed reducing their hours as they got older, and one person in a senior management role told us they planned to work as a delivery driver - a low-stress job that finished at the end of the working day.

        <p>
          Years of financial diligence and awareness of the choices available at the time of retirement both make a big difference to people feeling secure and ready to retire. ‘Owning’ the decision to retire lessens the shock of the lifestyle change. Making decisions with a partner is common; many delayed or brought forward their own retirement in order to retire at the same time as their partner.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have a long term workplace pension, the financial safety net enables shrugging off workplace political tensions by deciding to leave work. One woman in less secure employment struggled with feeling that her time at work had ended prematurely. Age is less of a barrier to staying in work than attitude: <q>If you’re not ready to retire, then don’t!</q>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some reported having chased higher paid management positions in the years running up to retirement, in order to boost their pensions - even if they didn’t enjoy the work. Retirement requires compromising between living in the present and planning for the future.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            [in the last five years] we had both been promoted into higher management jobs - it was quite stressful - we were starting to think about retiring and appreciating this time as we are still quite young and wanting to appreciate it. We were starting the countdown.

          Paying off the mortgage is the primary trigger to begin thinking about retirement. Without that monthly obligation, a lower monthly income becomes a feasible option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone acknowledged the drop in income that comes in retirement. That can make a discernable difference to daily life, but tended not to cause extreme anxiety. One retiree told us about how much more careful she is when food shopping. Another told us that <q>I always worry about how we’ll manage, but I think we’ll be OK</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Retirees talked about <q>checking out their options</q> to find out how much they’d receive in retirement before deciding what to do. Those with final salary pensions knew that they were lucky: they received a good monthly income, and they had never had to worry about how much they were saving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Financial advice came from family members, friends, ex-colleagues, and from company pension schemes. One man meets up with ex-colleagues (he didn’t call them friends) to discuss financial tips and tricks, like receiving National Insurance credits for looking after grandchildren. He trusted peer advice over the financial advisor who turned up for an appointment in a Porsche.

          For some, they are as busy retired as they were when they were working. One retiree told us of a friend who <q>practically works full time</q> with voluntary work. Looking after grandchildren, housework, photography courses, lunch with friends and generally <q>pottering about</q> make some retirees wonder how they could ever have fit in full time work.
        </p>
        <p>
          We saw a loose correlation between income levels during working lives and happiness in retirement. Retirees with income above the state pension have more options available to them, and make plans accordingly. Those without extra income have fewer options. A GP in Sheffield told us about patients living on the state pension struggling to stay active without work filling their days, and booking GP appointments just for a chat. This lack of activity and social interaction leads to feelings of depression and hopelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoever you are, though, days can be long. A motivated morning spent renovating the house can slip into an afternoon watching quiz shows. For retirees without a partner, evenings can drag on. We heard a lot about social lunches and coffees - and not very much about dinner.

          Retiring means that people no longer see their colleagues day in day out. If people’s social networks were predominantly work based, this can come as quite a shock.

          Some of the participants that were enjoying retirement described how they put effort into meeting up with old friends and colleagues at lunch socials, or monthly meals out.

          Going through retirement is clearly an emotional time. Retirees really appreciated being able to share their experiences with others going through the same thing. This might be ex-colleagues, friends or a partner.

        <p>
          It felt more challenging for people when they themselves had retired but their partner hadn’t yet. Some participants felt like they were waiting, in limbo, and one lady described herself as <q>spending a lot of time on my own</q>. While one person had thrown herself into helping revive a Church in London she recognised that most of the other volunteers there were in their 20s or 30s and she missed being able to talk about how she was feeling going into later life.

      <p>
        We created a prototype of Protect Together. Small groups of people with something in common (living in the same area in the same type of accommodation) could form a group and insure each other. Members would pay a regular contribution to a fund, and claims under a certain amount would come out of that fund. The group would decide what to do with any money left over (split between members or invest in their community to reduce the group’s risk), or what action to take if the fund ran low. We showed the prototype to six people who fit the requirements for our example group.

      <p>
        Explore different types of groups that people might associate with. We should experiment with whether individuals associate and trust other people based on age, salary, job, interests. We could also look at whether it makes a difference if the group already know each other in another context or come together specifically to take part in the scheme.
      </p>

      <p>
        Explore different sizes of groups that people might join. We didn’t explicitly show the size of the Green Quarter group. A future design sprint might present respondents with different size groups to better understand how they feel about this and how they might communicate.

      <h3>Using personal and professional relationships to understand complex issues</h3>

      <p>
        The journalists we spoke to used different sources for their stories: PR agencies, manufacturers, their own research, awareness of trends through personal contacts and online communities (Reddit). Some were happy to be contacted by PR companies and manufacturers. Others deliberately avoided them, only contacting them to give them a chance to respond to a negative story.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I’ve seen PR companies get better at what they do&hellip; Generally products and stories get pitched. Could be research, tip or physical product.

        </p>
        <p>
          One cultivates individuals in companies, contacts and one also sometimes you know very often you formally deal with a press team to get comment generally on stories which are adverse to them or where you’d be compromising into your contact to quote or whatever, to some extent you have to protect your sources … but again that’s just journalism.

        <p>
          Occasionally a great place to find breaking news is Twitter and Reddit, but you have to be extremely careful when using those sources. So you have to make the effort to corroborate it.

          Erm. I think, if there’s some sort of hover over JaneS’s profile and see that she was a lawyer or student lawyer or that she’s a security advocate. Verified profiles would be cool, like Twitter.

        No - not like this. It was clear what Legalease was for. However, participants’ reactions were mixed as to whether it was something they’d use during their writing process. They wanted to see stronger expert opinions and summaries (as opposed to commentary and questions) and worried about how qualified the contributors were.

      <p>
        Some of the journalists we spoke to perceived their audience as either not caring about privacy issues, or being resigned to a lack of privacy. What does motivate their readers however are the more obvious, less conceptual problems - being bombarded by targeted ads, concerns about being ‘ripped off’. Our goal should be to connect the more abstract issues around data protection and privacy to the real-world manifestations of those issues. Only then should we explain why these annoying things keep happening - and in plain, everyday language.

      It’s not always clear that data is being captured, how that information

        <h2>An app doesn’t suit everybody</h2>
        <p>Retailers were worried about how they and their staff would use the app. Some were worried about it being time consuming and fiddly, and others thought it would be wrong to ask staff to use their own data whilst using the app in the shop. We also heard that not all their customers had smartphones, and would therefore miss out.
