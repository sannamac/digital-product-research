        It’s getting harder for independents to compete with online shops and global chains.

        And when those businesses shut down, they leave gaps in the local economy as well as the high street.

        Could Co-op encourage shoppers to spend their money locally and support their local economy?

        We showed 6 independent retailers in Chorlton a prototype of Locally, a scheme that earns shoppers ‘perks’, redeemable in any participating business, when they shop with local independent retailers.

        Reaction to the core concept (earning points with one business and getting the perk from another) was mixed, and there were concerns about the practicalities of asking staff to use an app.

        Some local retailers were open to idea behind Locally, and were interesting in seeing the concept develop. However, most did not like the idea of shoppers earning perks in other shops and redeeming them in theirs, and felt the system could disadvantage them.

        We heard mixed opinions about local business associations, that they were old fashioned and not very effective. Local business associations as technological platforms would be an interesting area for the Co-op to explore next.
