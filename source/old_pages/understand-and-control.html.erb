    <p class="observation">
      People don’t take data privacy into account when buying connected devices - information about security is not often covered in product reviews and press coverage about new products.
    </p>

    <h2>How much do people know about the vulnerabilities of their “smart” devices?</h2>

        <p>
      We learned that awareness of the risks associated with using devices that connect to the internet tends to be low. Most of our participants had not thought about how secure or private the connection between their devices and the internet was.
    </p>

    <h2>Can we make the security exploits visible and understandable?</h2>
        <blockquote>It sounds like, when you’re sitting in a room with a smart TV, it could potentially be sent to a third party.</blockquote>

    <p>
      When we showed them the Scout prototype, our participants immediately understood the implications for an individual’s privacy and the risk of a wider botnet attack.
    </p>

    <h2>Would people change change their behaviour once they understood about vulnerabilities?</h2>
    <p>
      Although our participants quickly grasped how the connected devices in our simulation would compromise their own privacy, and potentially contribute to a wider security risk, in most cases they would not chose to turn off these devices.

    </p>
    <blockquote> But again, if I’ve spent a lot of money on it. I don’t know if I would. I don’t know. Just stick to it and take the risk, potentially.</blockquote>
     <p>
      We learned that, as they enjoyed using the devices in their home, the value they got from them outweighed the alarm they felt after finding out about the security risks. In our next piece of work in this area, we focused on influencing buying behaviour, to encourage people to buy safer devices.

    <h2>Can we get people to trust Co-op with highly personal information?</h2>
