<h2>Getting out of the office</h2>
<p>
    Going on a field trip meant that we were able to speak to an expert in their own environment. We were able to check whether we were right about the things we had assumed and to find out where we’d got things wrong. Bringing people into a setting that was unfamiliar for both them and us made conversation flow more naturally than if we’d brought them to a more formal interview setting.
