        A lack of trust has broken insurance. Lots of people make fraudulent claims, which means insurers create policies that make it harder to claim, which means bona fide customers can’t make a claim when they need to. There’s space for Co-op to try some radically new approaches to insurance: local, mutual, community focused and owned by members.

    <section class="question">
      <p>
        How might we create an insurance model where everyone trusted everyone else, and where members felt confident about making a claim?

        We created a prototype of a new type of insurance scheme, where small groups of people with something in common (living in the same area in the same type of accommodation) could form a group and insure each other. Members would pay a regular contribution to a fund, and claims under a certain amount would come out of that fund. The group would decide what to do with any money left over (split between members or invest in their community to reduce the group’s risk), or what action to take if the fund ran low.

        We showed the prototype to X people who fit the requirements for our example group. However, the concept of a group based purely on location and accommodation type did not go down well. The people we spoke to did not necessarily know or trust their neighbours. However, the overall concept was well received. We should revisit our prototype, and make it possible for people to join a group based on other attributes - such as owners of expensive bikes.
