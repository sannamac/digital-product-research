      <p>Independents can’t compete with online shops and global chains. And when those businesses shut down, they leave gaps in the local economy as well as the high street.

    <section class="complication">
      <h2>High streets are changing</h2>
      <p>
        As family businesses and independent shops close down, they are often replaced by e-cigarette shops and tattoo parlours, which serve a narrow market. In richer areas, shops are replaced by cafes, bars and restaurants, which shifts the economy from day to night.

      <h2>A shared loyalty scheme for independent retailers</h2>
      <p>
        We showed six independent retailers in Chorlton a prototype of Locally, a scheme that earns shoppers ‘perks’, redeemable in any participating business, when they shop with local independent retailers.

      <p>
        Reaction to the core concept (earning points with one business and getting the perk from another) was mixed, and there were concerns about the practicalities of asking staff to use an app.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some local retailers were open to the idea behind Locally, and were interested in seeing the concept develop. However, most did not like the idea of shoppers earning perks in other shops and redeeming them in theirs, and felt the system could disadvantage them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We heard mixed opinions about local business associations, that they were old fashioned and not very effective. Local business associations as technological platforms would be an interesting area for the Co-op to explore next.

        <h2>An app doesn’t suit everybody</h2>
        <p>Retailers were worried about how they and their staff would use the app. Some were worried about it being time consuming and fiddly, and others thought it would be wrong to ask staff to use their own data whilst using the app in the shop. We also heard that not all their customers had smartphones, and would therefore miss out.

        <h2>Retailers worry about losing out</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of Locally was to increase local shopping overall, by offering rewards to people who shop with any local retailer. However some of the people we spoke to were worried that they would lose out, that shoppers would earn their ‘perks’ in other shops and redeem them in theirs. They were not convinced that they would benefit from new people coming into their shops.

            I have to give money to get people to come into our shop - which devalues all the hard work that we put in - it says that what we have isn’t enough. I don’t want to read any more. It instantly makes me go ugh.
